# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-in-Video
This repository demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 for object detection in video using Python within an Anaconda environment. The project leverages the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to detect objects frame-by-frame in a video.
# Features
Detect objects in video files using the YOLOv8 model.
Visualize detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
# Requirements
Before running the code, ensure you have Anaconda installed on your system.
Install Anaconda: If you don't have it yet, you can download and install Anaconda from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).
Create a new Anaconda environment for the project:

`conda create -n yolov8-env python=3.8`
