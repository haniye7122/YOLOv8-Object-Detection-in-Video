# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-in-Video
This repository demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 for object detection in video using Python within an Anaconda environment. The project leverages the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to detect objects frame-by-frame in a video.
# Features
Detect objects in video files using the YOLOv8 model.
Visualize detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
